--Custom/Optional/Fun Rules--
1) Roll Your Own Options: Any time you would receive option cards, draw one extra and choose the one(s) you want, then return a card to the draw pile. (Examples: you would draw one card, instead you draw two, choose one, and put one back; you would draw 2 cards, instead you draw 3, choose two, and put one back)
2) Kick It Off With A Bang: At the start of the game, each player is awarded 2 option cards (draw 3, keep 2, put 1 back).
3) Built In Recompiler: all robots have the option to exchange all their program cards received this turn for new ones. The player then receives 1 point of damage. You may use this as many times as you like, but you may not kill yourself.
4) Built In Abort Switch: All robots have the option to randomize the rest of their program cards for the rest of the turn.
5) Never Say Die: All bots have unlimited lives (but you still have to discard an option card if you die).
6) Superior Archive Copy: All bots respawn undamaged.
7) Speed Things Up (for advanced players only): If all players have damage, the first player to say "Done!" once finished programming all their cards gets to take one point of damage off.
8) Robot Revival: Upon death, robots revive immediately where they normally would be spawned. The player receives a new hand of cars equal to the number they would normally get minus the number of turns that have passed. The player then programs the cards and everyone finished out the turn.


--Mini Games Rules--
Roll a dice to figure out which game you are playing.
Unless otherwise specified, bots can push other bots but nothing else.
Unless otherwise specified, each player is dealt a new hand for each round/turn.
Any damage or death occurring in mini games does not carry over to the main game.
